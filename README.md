# 🦾 Eliza Daemon

> **Autonomous AI Agent for XMRT DAO Operations**

An intelligent background daemon that monitors, reasons, and acts on behalf of the XMRT DAO community. Eliza listens to events across multiple platforms, uses AI-powered reasoning via LangChain, and takes autonomous actions like distributing rewards, creating proposals, and engaging with the community.

## 🎯 What Eliza Does

- **🔍 Monitors**: Twitter followers, miner statistics, DAO events
- **🧠 Reasons**: Uses GPT-4 via LangChain for intelligent decision making  
- **⚡ Acts**: Distributes rewards, creates proposals, sends notifications
- **💾 Remembers**: Persistent memory via Supabase for context-aware decisions
- **📊 Reports**: Comprehensive logging and Discord notifications

## ⚡ Key Features

- ✨ **Fully Autonomous Operation** - Runs continuous 10-minute decision loops
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Reasoning** - GPT-4 integration via LangChain agents
- 📡 **Multi-Source Monitoring** - Twitter, mining data, governance events
- 🎯 **Action-Oriented** - Reward distribution, proposal creation, community engagement
- 💾 **Persistent Memory** - Supabase backend for long-term context
- 🔔 **Real-time Notifications** - Discord webhooks and DAO dashboard integration
- 📝 **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of all decisions and actions
